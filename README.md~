# Boosting_GaussianClassification
Classification with Boosting and Gaussian Process

Classification with Boosting is done on MNIST Dataset. In order to read the dataset, Stanford University's loader has been used. The whole code can be run via main.m. The comments in the code explains the code. In order to run the system with different parameters, simply change them. If you want to see the results of all runs at the same time, simply put the functions into a for loop.

Gaussian Process Classifiers has been used from www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml. The training and testing data are produced during implementation by giving the number of data points, mean values and covariance values. In order to check and run the system, simply run the demoClassification.m under /doc/ folder. The code is explained with the comments. In the end, accuracy rates are calculated and histogram of uncertainties are plotted.
